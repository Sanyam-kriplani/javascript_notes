// we use dom selectors to select any element in the html document
//there are following mostly used selectors
//getElementByClassName()
//selects the element by the class name
//getElementById()
//it selects the element by the id 
//getElementByTagName()
//selects the item by the tag name like h1.
//querySelector()
//it selects the first element matching the given id,class or tag.

//querySelectorAll
//it is different from the previous fuction as it returns a Nodelist of the matching elements
//Nodelists are the collection of the elements but they are not purely  arrays
//Nodelists only support foreach loop

//getElementByClassName() & getElementbytagname returns a html collection.
//HTMLcollections are also the collection but they donot support any iteration either

//so to use the function of arrays on Nodelists and HTMLcollections we convert them into the array by using Array.from() method.
